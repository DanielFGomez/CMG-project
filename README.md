# CMG-project
Scripts used for the CMG (Control Moment Gyroscopes) reinforcement learning control project
The folder Control contains matlab scripts and Arduino sketches used to control the physical apparathus.
The folder named simulations contains the simulations made in Simmechanics and matlab of the dynamic behaviour of the system of gyroscopes
the folder named sgcmgLearning contains the simulations of the reinforcement learning algorithm used to control the system of gyroscopes
